<dl><dd> <b>Not OK:</b> I wanted to be consistent, because if we want to be precise and write <i>id-expression</i> for the second operand of the member operators we must keep that precision for the pointer-to-member operators and write <i>cast-expression</i> for their second operand too (according to the standard). So we have to make a choice here: either we write <i>id-expression</i> for member operators and <i>cast-expression</i> for pointer-to-member operators, either we simply write <i>expression</i> for both, but not precise <i>id-expression</i> for the first and unprecise <i>expression</i> for the second as it was the case, or <i>vice versa</i>.

<dl><dd> &quot;cast-expression&quot; is one of the BNF grammar productions that are, in human language, known as &quot;operator precedence and associativity&quot;. You won&#39;t find it by that name in that table. Like all other expressions (other than the confusingly-named &quot;id-expression&quot;), cast-expressions can perform calculations, make function calls, print to screen, etc. &quot;id-expression&quot; is just a name of a variable, it can do no computation. --<a href="./User:Cubbi.html" title="User:Cubbi">Cubbi</a> (<a href="./User_talk:Cubbi.html" title="User talk:Cubbi">talk</a>) 09:04, 19 September 2015 (PDT)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></div>

<dl><dd> It is used in the standard to highlight that it&#39;s not a data member of the instance object <code>E1</code> but of the naming class of <code>E1</code> since it&#39;s static.

<dl><dd> I don&#39;t know what &quot;the naming class&quot; means.

<dl><dd> The page quoted an earlier revision of the C++ spec.

<dl><dd> Old wording was correct for C++98 and C++03. It was published as part of C++11, but it was actually an error in the C++11 standard. It was processed as core working group defect report 616 in 2013. The new wording was published as part of C++14, but it applies retroactively to C++11 compilers. Our (new) policy is to post new wording under &quot;c++11&quot; tag and add a line to the defect reports table at the bottom. --<a href="./User:Cubbi.html" title="User:Cubbi">Cubbi</a> (<a href="./User_talk:Cubbi.html" title="User talk:Cubbi">talk</a>) 20:00, 18 September 2015 (PDT)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></div>
